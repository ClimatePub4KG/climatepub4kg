          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Climate science publications have grown exponentially, exceeding 1.3
            million since 2020. While these studies contain valuable
            insights—such as model predictions, observational data, and impact
            assessments—relevant information often remains buried within
            unstructured text. This situation poses a challenge for researchers,
            policymakers, and anyone needing systematic, up-to-date knowledge.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a way
            forward, offering powerful text processing and generalization
            abilities. However, LLMs often struggle with specialized domains
            like climate science, where rare or evolving terminology (e.g.,
            “teleconnections” or “Arctic amplification”) can lead to missed
            concepts or incorrect associations. In other words, while LLMs excel
            at broad knowledge, they require domain-specific grounding to truly
            handle the complexity and precision demanded by climate research.

            <li>
              <strong>Aggregating Climate Publications:</strong> We curate a
              large repository of climate-related texts, ensuring coverage of a
              wide range of topics, from Earth system modeling to policy-driven
              studies.

              of the extracted knowledge.

              reducing manual workload.

        {/* GCMD+ Taxonomy Section */}
        <section id="ClimatePub4KG" className="section">
          <h2>What is ClimatePub4KG?</h2>
          <p>
            GCMD+ taxonomy is an extension of the most recent version of the
            Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) from NASA. To enhance the
            taxonomy's breadth and depth, we incorporated additional resources,
            specifically the CMIP6 Controlled Vocabularies (CMIP6CV),
            observations for the Model Intercomparison Project (obs4MIPs), and
            the vocabulary listing from the CMIP Publication Hub, all accessed
            as of May 2024. Each of the entities in the GCMD+ taxonomy was
            assigned tags based on their hierarchical paths, focusing
            specifically on main and sub-categories identified as non-leaf
            nodes. The GCMD+ taxonomy provides a comprehensive set of terms that
            are essential for categorizing and accessing climate science
            literature, particularly for climate modeling research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building upon the GCMD+ taxonomy, we now utilize ESGF dataset
            metadata to construct a structured knowledge graph that captures key
            relationships across climate data. This includes integrating ESGF
            entities such as source_id, experiment_id, variable_id, and
            activity_id to represent climate models, experiments, and simulation
            variables. To enrich the semantic structure, we also incorporate
            selected entity types from GCMD allowing for a more expressive and
            interconnected ontology. This combined schema results in a much
            richer knowledge graph that enables finer-grained reasoning over
            climate datasets, improves dataset discoverability, and supports
            automated alignment between models, experiments, and observational
            references.

            The figure shows a combined ontology graph linking two domains:
            Combined GCMD and ESGF Ontology (left): This graph integrates
            entities from the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) and Earth
            System Grid Federation (ESGF) metadata. Nodes are color-coded: green
            (GCMD-only), blue (ESGF-only), yellow (shared by both). It models
            relationships between climate modeling concepts such as Source,
            Experiment, Variable, Instrument, Platform, and Region. Paper
            Ontology (right): This represents metadata and conceptual
            information from academic papers. Central node is Title, connected
            to entities like Author, Institution, Field, Method, Model, Dataset,
            etc. It captures important information and metrics from the
            scientific literature/papers and is linked to the entities of
            Climate ontology. The black arrow labeled “Mentions” shows the
            linkage between paper content and climate model entities, enabling
            knowledge graph integration across literature and model metadata.

          <p>
            This project involves constructing a comprehensive Knowledge Graph
            by leveraging existing taxonomies, advanced language models, and
            post-processing techniques to organize climate science data and
            relationships. It begins with aggregating existing taxonomies
            mentioned in GCMD+. Climate publications are then analyzed to create
            structured prompts that guide a large language model to extract key
            entities (e.g., precipitation, regions) and their relationships
            (e.g., "precipitation measured at North America"). Post-processing
            methods are applied to minimize errors or hallucinations introduced
            by the model, ensuring accuracy and relevance. The extracted and
            refined entities and relationships are integrated into a Knowledge
            Graph, providing a structured and interconnected representation of
            climate science data. This Knowledge Graph enables more efficient
            discovery, categorization, and use of climate modeling resources,
            fostering collaboration and innovation in climate research.
